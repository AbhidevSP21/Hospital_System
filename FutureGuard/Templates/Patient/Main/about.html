      <h2 class="section-header mb-3">Our Story</h2>
      <p>FutureGuard was born from our collective experience and observations in the healthcare sector. As a team of three passionate individuals, we noticed a recurring issue in hospitals—long wait times and inefficiencies in patient scheduling. These delays not only caused frustration for patients but also put additional strain on healthcare providers. We knew there had to be a better way to manage this crucial aspect of healthcare delivery.

        Driven by a shared vision to make healthcare more efficient and patient-friendly, we embarked on a mission to create a solution that would address these challenges head-on. We envisioned a web app that could intelligently schedule patients based on doctors' availability, thereby reducing wait times and optimizing the use of medical resources. Our goal was simple: to create a system that saves time for both patients and healthcare providers, ultimately improving the overall healthcare experience.

        Through dedication, innovation, and a deep understanding of the needs within the healthcare industry, we developed FutureGuard. This platform is designed not only to streamline patient scheduling but also to provide comprehensive healthcare solutions that cater to the needs of administrators, physicians, and patients alike. Our story is one of collaboration, problem-solving, and a commitment to making a positive impact on the healthcare system.</p>
